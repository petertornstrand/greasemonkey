Contains user scripts for improving the UI and functionality of various parts of [Codebase](https://www.codebasehq.com).

The scripts are split into different files each dealing with a separate scope of the Codebase application.

## Tickets

* **Copy ticket reference**: Adds a "copy ticket reference" button next to the ticket title that lets you copy
  the ticket number and subject for easy pasting into you time tracker.
* **Jump to last comment**: Adds the comment count and a quick link to scroll the latest comment into view.
* **Display tags in meta**: Moves the tags to the top of the ticket into the ticket meta area. Also adds the
  ability to use "tag prefixes" that affects the color and icon of the tag. Available prefixes `branch:` and
  `note:`.
