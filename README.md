# User scripts for Codebase

Contains user scripts for improving the UI and functionality of various parts of [Codebase](https://www.codebasehq.com).

The scripts are split into different files each dealing with a separate scope of the Codebase application.

* Global
* Projects
* Tickets
* Users

## User script mananger

I suggest using [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) to manage your user scripts.
